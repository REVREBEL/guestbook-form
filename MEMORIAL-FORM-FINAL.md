## What You Have Now

A simple guestbook form that writes to Webflow CMS.

## The Form

**Form Action**: `/guestbook-form/api/guestbook`  
**Form Method**: `POST`

## The API Endpoint

**File**: `src/pages/api/guestbook.ts`

**URL**: `/guestbook-form/api/guestbook` (handles POST requests)

**What It Does**:
1. Receives form data
2. Validates required fields (full_name, email)
3. Generates a unique slug and edit code
4. Writes to Webflow CMS collection

## The Page

**File**: `src/pages/guestbook.astro`

**URL**: `/guestbook-form/guestbook`

**What It Does**:
- Renders the Webflow form component
- Nothing more, nothing less

## Required Fields

- `full_name` - Person's name

## Optional Fields

- `guestbook_location` - Where they're from
- `guestbook_first_met` - How they knew your mom
- `guestbook_relationship` - Their relationship

## How It Works

1. User fills out form on `/guestbook-form/guestbook`
2. User clicks Submit
3. Form POSTs to `/guestbook-form/api/guestbook`
4. API validates data
5. API creates entry in Webflow CMS
6. User sees success message

## That's It

No React modals, no embedded scripts, no complexity. Just a form that writes to a database.
